  p.
    For individual assignments, I expect you to complete the work entirely by
    yourself. Passing someone else's work as your own will not be tolerated. 
    However, I encourage you to discuss course topics with me or your peers! 
    Often all it takes to understand a topic is to talk it through with 
    someone else. If you're unclear about this distinction, I'd be happy to 
    talk it over with you.
